# Pokémon Yveltal's Awakening Public repo
## Public repo of Pokémon: Yveltal's Awakening. 
Please note that i will not release source code nor any related to that **EVER in this repository!** I will *eventually* publish the whole private repo, with Makefile and stuff. But don't star or watch this repo expecting to someday see the source code **in this repo.**

***

Hey! This is my official releases repo. It's an isolated repo from the original one, for avoid sharing the source code *by now*. Here i will upload images, songs, videos and .gba files ready to play on any emulator! We suggest [mGBA](https://mgba.io/) for PC, because it's compatible with Windows, Ubuntu and Mac, and so it is with Nintendo Switch, 3DS, Wii and PS Vita. If you want to play from Android, you can use [My Boy!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastemulator.gba).
